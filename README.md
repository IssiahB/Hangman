# Hangman
A small command line hang man game I made, while learning python.

The program connects to a database that has been automatically filled with words from online sources. This is a small project that was used to help me understand fundamentals of the python programming language. There are only two .py files, one file (WordsDB.py) connects to the database with a function that grabs one random word from said database. The other file has the brains and operations of the hangman game.
